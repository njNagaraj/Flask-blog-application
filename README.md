# Flask-blog-application

# Full fledged Blog Application Using Python, Flask

Like twitter, User can post their thought, everyone can see it,
User can create account, Login, post, see profiles.

Uses Bootstrap, Flask web framework, SqlAlchemy for database
connection.

Uses wtfrorms, flask_login, bcrypt.

Perfectly organized the code using Layout Inheritance and
Packages and Blueprints

Note : the exatra env directory and lock,toml,nix extension files are not needed to run the website (these are created because i developed the project using Replit IDE  which is easy to develop projects without any system requirements).
